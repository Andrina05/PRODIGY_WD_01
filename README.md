A basic set of web pages for an e-learning website with an interactive navigation menu/bar. Features:
1) The navigation bar changes its background colour and gets a shadow below it when the user scrolls down a page. In addition, hovering over each element in the menu gives them a white, button-like background.
2) JavaScript code to detect when a user has scrolled down so that the new styling can be applied to the navigation bar, and removed when the user scrolls back up.
3) Basic codes for the home page, about page, courses page and contact page to allow scrolling.
4) Styling applied in a mostly blue colour scheme.
